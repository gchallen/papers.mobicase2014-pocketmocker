\section{Implementation}
\label{sec-implementation}

We implemented a \PocketMocker{} prototype on Android 4.2.2 ``Jelly Bean'',
Android being the only open-source smartphone platform permitting the
platform modifications \PocketMocker{} requires. Our current prototype
supports recording and replaying context traces and mocking location,
available networks and signal strengths, and sensors including the GPS,
accelerometer and gyroscopes. We have deployed our prototype on the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus smartphone~\cite{galaxynexus} which was used for the experiments
in Section~\ref{sec-evaluation}.

% read from sysfs? no?

We considered implementing \PocketMocker{} support in two ways: either by
modifying Android platform services, or by making changes to the underlying
Linux kernel. Most Android platform services provide thin wrappers around
low-level Linux interfaces in order to provide and protect Android interfaces
to modifying core smartphone features. For example, the \texttt{WifiManager}
Android interface for switching access points translates requests from apps
with permission to use the interface into the appropriate manipulations of
the wireless connection state using tools that unprivileged Android apps lack
the permissions to use. Because Android apps typically use Android's service
interfaces to collect information about the device, such as determining the
access point that the smartphone is currently associated with, it is possible
to implement successful mocking with these services and fool many apps.

Unfortunately, the underlying Linux interfaces on Android leak a great deal
of information about the state of the system that apps could use to pierce
the mocking context. For example, reading \texttt{/prot/net/arp} allows an
unprivileged app to determine the access point the smartphone is associated
with in the same way as a call to the \texttt{WifiManager} Android service.
So implementing mocking \textit{only} within the Android platform is not
sufficient to fully secure the mocking context, since apps may be able to
bypass services participating in the mocked process. The most secure way to
implement mocking would be to make changes to the Linux kernel itself to
ensure that all information provided by the system would be consistent.

At present, however, our current \PocketMocker{} prototype is implemented as
a set of changes to Android. This is for two reasons. First, \PocketMocker{}
is currently designed to fool unsuspecting apps, and we have left as future
work the task of exploring ways apps could attack the mocking context and
effective \PocketMocker{} countermeasures, including moving mocking support
into Linux itself. Our evaluation demonstrates that platform changes are
sufficient to mock many different apps. Second, modifying Android reduced the
developer effort needed to produce a working prototype.

% 02 Apr 2014 : GWA : NR TODO : Finish with specific details.

The architecture of \PocketMocker{} consists of two major components, one
sitting in the app layer and the other in the Android platform. We handle user
interaction, data logging and data replaying in the app layer. In the platform,
we have made modifications allowing \PocketMocker{} to notify user-installed
apps of mocked location and sensory updates through their respective Java
classes.

Our implementation of record and replay is user initiated at the app-level.
When a user begins the recording process, \PocketMocker{} aggressively logs
device event data---including all sensors, GPS updates, cell tower updates and
WiFi updates---to its SQLite datastore. By storing this data at the app-level,
we can synchronize event broadcasts at the app-level by having the platform
listen for updates from the \PocketMocker{} replay service, a standard Android
\texttt{Service}. The replay service works by reading events from the datastore
in chronological order and notifying modified managers in the platform of the
mocked data.

We have instrumented changes to the Android platform that allows each of the
associated managers (\texttt{SensorManager}, \texttt{LocationManager},
\texttt{WifiManager} and \texttt{TelephonyManager}) to communicate with the
\PocketMocker{} replay service. The managers implement \texttt{Messenger}
handlers to receive \texttt{Messages} from external channels and communicate
with the replay service. On construction, a modified manager sends a
\texttt{Message} to the replay service, notifying the service of its existence
and establishing a bidirectional channel of communication. On receipt of a
\texttt{Message} containing mocked data from the replay service, we call all
callbacks registered with the manager, e.g.
\texttt{LocationListener.onLocationChanged}, with the newly received mocked
data. To preserve the integrity of the mocking context, real sensor events are
prevented from being published to apps when \PocketMocker{} is in replay-mode.
