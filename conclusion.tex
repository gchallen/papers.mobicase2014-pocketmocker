\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

In this paper, we have introduced the notion of objective-driven context
mocking to help users protect their digital personas on their mobile devices.
We have discussed \PocketMocker{}, a prototype implementing a record and
replay system to evaluate the idea of objective-driven mocking and mocking
sensor data in general. Through our case studies, we have found the prototype
was able to mislead multiple apps with minimal overhead. Not only did
we find that this was technically feasible, but users are excited about the
idea of being able to mock their data and want to be able to use
\PocketMocker{} in the future to protect their digital identities.
