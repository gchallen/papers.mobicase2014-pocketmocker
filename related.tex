\section{Related Work}
\label{sec-related}

While \PocketMocker{} is the first system to provide objective-driven context
mocking, worries about smartphone app data collection have led to a number of
previous efforts in this area. We divide related work into several
categories. First, we examine mocking-based approaches similar to
\PocketMocker{} which deny apps access to data by returning fake or bogus
values. Second, we look at novel ways to detect malicious apps or malicious
app behavior through static analysis and information flow tracking. Finally,
we examine proposals to improve Android's permission model to make it more
effective and user-friendly.

\subsection{Mocking Approaches}

AppFence~\cite{droids-ccs11} is one example that uses data shadowing,
blocking, and mocking to selectively deny data to apps on a
per-permission basis. When apps request data the user has chosen to
deny them, such as their phone number or email address, empty or fixed bogus
values are returned. MockDroid~\cite{mockdroid-hotmobile11} is another
example of a similar system. Both these approaches focus on achieving privacy
by limiting access to data, rather than achieving user objectives by
manipulating data that apps do have access to, and we consider these efforts
orthogonal to \PocketMocker{}.

\subsection{Record and Replay}

\PocketMocker{} utilizes the idea of record and replay as a first attempt of
implementing objective-driven mocking on Android. Record and replay is not a
new concept in general, but there has recently been a focus on instrumenting
this type of procedure on mobile devices~\cite{recordreplay-hotmobile11}.
There are a few systems in existence, but the majority of research efforts
for this type of system seems to be focused on developer testing and
app performance. For instance, there is RERAN~\cite{gomez2013reran},
which captures input events at the filesystem level for later programmatic
replay; another example of such a testing system is
VanarSera~\cite{vanarsena-mobisys14}, which records event data then
distributes it to multiple ``monkeys'' or slave devices for parallel testing;
there is also AppInsight~\cite{appinsight-osdi12}, an app-layer
instrumentation that helps identify critical paths in user transactions on a
per-app basis. Despite this focus, there is interest in using record and
replay systems to bring permission issues to light~\cite{permissions-spsm12}.

\subsection{Permissions Improvements}

A number of previous systems have explored ways to overcome Android's
``take-it-or-leave-it'' permission model by allowing apps to run but
selectively denying them access to information that they think they can
access. There are other approaches out there to try to amend this model by
allowing users to decide which permissions to accept~\cite{apex-asiaccs10},
but users could accidentally reduce app functionality by rejecting a
particular permission. Giving users the ability to selectively accept
permissions does not fix the current permissions model because many
apps request permissions for private data that are necessary only to
third-party components, like advertising libraries~\cite{addroid-asiaccs12}.
To thwart this, AdDroid separates the requested permissions by
advertiser-required and application-required.
